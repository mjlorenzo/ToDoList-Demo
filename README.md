# ToDoList-Demo

Hey all! For this project I've constructed my version of the classic "To Do List" to learn a new suite of web technologies. A brief summary is below:

- Single page application constructed using the React and Redux libraries and associated bindings
- Uses the reselect library for memoized selector functions
- Employs axios to manage AJAX API calls and CSRF token cookies
- Applies redux-thunk middleware for asynchronous action dispatch upon HTTP request resolution
- RESTful API constructed using Django REST Framework
- Implements CRUD operations for to-do list items
- User authentication and registration provided by rest-auth library for Django
