# ToDoList-Demo

Hey all! For this project I am constructing a basic "To Do List" application to explore and practice web technologies I'm unfamiliar with.
In particular, I'll be constructing the user interface with React-Redux, using Django REST as the framework and SQLite as the current
backing store. I hopefully will be experimenting with implementing both MySQL and MongoDB database technologies as some point in the future.
